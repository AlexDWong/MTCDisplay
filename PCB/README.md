#PCB Files

Enclosed here are the files needed to have a PCB manufactured, as well as a Bill of Materials. There are currently **two** revisions; **both revisions use identical parts and share the same BOM**:

##Version 1.0

This is the original MTCDisplay, and the design has been proven (i.e. assembled, tested and confirmed working). The folder contains Gerber files for the top/bottom silkscreens, copper layers, soldermasks, and drill file. There is also a file listing all non-plated through holes for specific fab houses which request it.

##Version 1.1

This is the current MTCDisplay, but the design **has not been proven**. The layout is identical to Version 1.0; however, the package for the 7-segment displays has been updated and the board slightly reduced in depth to allow the displays to be flush against the edge. The folder contains an Eagle schematic and board file.
