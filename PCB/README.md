#PCB Files

Enclosed here are the files needed to have a PCB manufactured, as well as a Bill of Materials.

## Versions
### Version 1.1
Resolved several issues:
* All capacitors have been replaced with 0603 ceramic variants to reduce board space.
* LCD display package has been corrected; displays now protrude slightly over the edge of the board instead of being 1/4" from the edge.
* MIDI OUT/THRU switch removed
* Fixed silkscreen part names and text placement
* Added 0603 LED for power indication
* Added 0.100", 2x3 ICSP header to program Arduino directly
* Added diode to RESET signal
* Added reverse-polarity and over-current protection to input.

### Version 1.0
Initial release. This version has been tested and is proven to work as described. Only Gerber files and a BOM are included.
